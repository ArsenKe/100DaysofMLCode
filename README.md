# 100DaysofMLCode
On this repository I will be updating all the stuff that I do every day related to Machine Learning for the 100DaysofMLCode Challenge proposed by Siraj Raval.


DAY 1 : So this is the first day of #100DAYSOFMLCODE . I am so excited for the next 100 days that I am going to spend learning and using machine learning. 
Today was a great day. I attended the Chennai School of AI meetup and got to learn a lot of interesting things and got to know a lot of interesting people. 
We had a very fruitful discussion on applications of ML and AI. Got to know about interesting projects that some really experienced people had worked on. Some of them were --> Automatic quiz creation app, Chatbots, Detecting elephants near railways tracks and stopping them from being hit by trains, Automatic music creation web app(by the Dean himself) and many other interesting things. 
Also got to know about many new machine learning libraries like --> spacy, scikit, tensorflow, etc.
Had a very great day and I was inspired to learn ML and go deep into the field.
