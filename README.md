# 100DaysofMLCode
On this repository I will be updating all the stuff that I do every day related to Machine Learning for the 100DaysofMLCode Challenge proposed by Siraj Raval.


## DAY 1 : 
So this is the first day of #100DAYSOFMLCODE . I am so excited for the next 100 days that I am going to spend learning and using machine learning. 
Today was a great day. I attended the Chennai School of AI meetup and got to learn a lot of interesting things and got to know a lot of interesting people. 
We had a very fruitful discussion on applications of ML and AI. Got to know about interesting projects that some really experienced people had worked on. Some of them were --> Automatic quiz creation app, Chatbots, Detecting elephants near railways tracks and stopping them from being hit by trains, Automatic music creation web app(by the Dean himself) and many other interesting things. 
Also got to know about many new machine learning libraries like --> spacy, scikit, tensorflow, etc.
Had a very great day and I was inspired to learn ML and go deep into the field.


## DAY 2: 
Started with the Python for Data Science series by @sirajraval on YouTube. Made a simple gender classification code using weight, height and shoe size as the only inputs.
Made it with scikit-learn (Decision Tree) guided by siraj and further made the same using the scikit-learn KNearestNeighbors method and QuadraticDiscriminantAnalysis method.
It is awesome just how a few lines in Python can create a gender classification code. It felt really awesome writing my first machine learning code.

## DAY 3 :
Made a Twitter sentiment analysis code using libraries like tweepy and textblob. Followed the tutorial by @sirajraval , which is the second video in his Python for Data Science Series.

Completed the assignment and successfully created a csv file using the pandas library. You will find it soon on my github.

Learnt a bit about natural language processing from this tutorial and found it really interesting. 


## DAY 4 :
Learnt about vector spaces from MIT Open Courseware. Maths plays a very important role in ML. It is necessary to have good knowledge of linear algebra, probability and statistics and calculus.

All these can be valuable while developing your own machine learning algorithms. 

## DAY 5 :
 Made a movie recommendation system by following the third video of @sirajraval 's Python for Data Science series. 
I used three dependencies:
-- numpy
-- scipy
-- lightfm

lightfm is a library which has inbuilt recommendation system algorithms. Used the fetch_movielens function to gather all movie data and used warp as my loss function to improve the model and reduce the loss over time.

Learnt about two types of recommendation systems : --collabrative (similar users data)
--content based (only the users data) It was awesome learning and I was finally happy when I understood the whole code.

## DAY 6 :
 Do you want to get rich by investing in stock markets. Well then, Machine Learning can help you understand where to invest so as to get the most profit.

I developed a stock price prediction model by following @sirajraval 's fourth video in his Python for Data Science series.

I used the following dependencies :
- CSV
- numpy
- matplotlib
- sklearn.svm

## DAY 7 :
Today I revised Decision Tree Classifiers and made a simple model for predicting the type of iris flower.

I got a better understanding of training and testing data.

I used scikit learn and numpy as the major libraries

#100DaysofMLCode

## DAY 8 :
 Read a paper on the development of Speech Recognition systems while on my journey from Bangalore to Chennai.

Attended a coding competition in Bangalore and spent the whole day coding.

#100DaysofMLCode

## DAY 9 :
Learnt how to find accuracies of Machine Learning Algorithms ( basically Classifiers) using the sklearn.metrics function.

I found the accuracy of Decision Trees and KNeighbors Classifier using the iris dataset inbuilt inside scikitlearn.

For me Kneighborsclassifier turned out to be more accurate than Decision Trees.

#100DaysofMLCode .

## DAY 10 :
Made a small version of the KNeareatNeighbors Classifier. KNN basically works on the principle of Euclidean distance.

I got an accuracy of 96% using this classifier.

Though it is simple to make, this classifier may work slow if you have a huge amount of data. It also doesn't represent relationships between features and therefore doesn't not take everything into consideration.

Learnt this by following Josh Gordon on the @googledevs youtube channel.

## DAY 11 :
Revised what I have learned from the past 10 days.

Got a refresher and overview of the past 10 days.

Moving ahead from tomorrow... #100DaysofMLCode .

## DAY 12 :
 Learnt how to use Linear Regression using scikitlearn.

Applied it for predicting body weight using just the brain weight.

Made this by following @sirajraval 's 1st video in his intro Deep Learning series.

#100DaysofMLCode .


## DAY 13  :
I set up my github and uploaded all my work done till Day 12.

All ML Codes are available as .ipynb file.

Pls do contribute.


## DAY 14 : 
Started to read an online book named Neural Networks and Deep Learning by Michael Nielsen.

Learnt about perceptron -- a type of artificial Neuron.

#100DaysofMLCode .


## DAY 15 : 
Learnt about the Sigmoid Neuron and how it is similar to a perceptron.

A sigmoid Neuron is also known as a logistic Neuron and is another type of an artificial neuron, which has the self learning functionality.
