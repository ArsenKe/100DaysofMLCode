## T-Shirt Recommendation System

In this blog I will take you through the steps that I went through while making the T-shirt Recommendation System.

Basically I learnt to make this system back in summer by following the Introductory course by [Applied AI Course](https://www.appliedaicourse.com/)

The course is awesome and it takes you from the basic concepts like Linear Algebra to some very good concepts like bag of words and TF-IDF used in Machine Learning.

The basic libraries used in making of this system are :

1] scikit learn
2] pandas
3] numpy
4] matplotlib
5] keras

The following steps make up the whole system :

1] Creating a bag of words and finding Euledian Distance between every title 
2] Creating a TF-IDF system and then finding Eucledian Distance between every title
3] Using the VGG16 pre-trained Neural Network to do image comparison and then applying the Eucledian distance method.
4] Finally merging all the above methods and giving weights to all of the above methods and finding the best solution.
